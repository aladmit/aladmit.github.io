---

The Pulumi provider for Yandex.Cloud, which I started working on in mid-March, has been transferred to PulumiCorp!

Just now was the first official release. Support for all languages has been added, and documentation for each module with examples has been published on the site ðŸ”¥

So if you were afraid to use it because at some point I would get bored and give up on it, you can relax, it's in good hands))
