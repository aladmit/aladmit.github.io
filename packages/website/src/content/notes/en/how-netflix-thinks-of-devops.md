title: How Netflix Thinks of DevOps
---

Dave Hahn talked in a presentation about how Netflix thinks about DevOps. Spoiler: Nothing :)

The presentation emphasized that the most important thing in the company is the culture, which Netflix places above all else.

Also, on the Netflix website, there is a detailed description of their culture. I recommend taking a look at it, comparing it with your own, and thinking about how your current culture might be hindering your company's success.
