title: It Doesnt Have to Be Crazy at Work
---

I finished reading the latest book from Basecamp over the weekend. It's about how one of the company's main values should be the peace of mind of its employees. How to make it so that people can calmly do their work, not get nervous and not get distracted.

I'm not sure if the ideas described in the book will be suitable for everyone. The book, after all, is written from the experience of a product company, and perhaps this approach is not applicable to all types of businesses.

Nevertheless, I recommend it to everyone) Even if the ideas suddenly cannot be applied throughout the company, the practices from the book can make your work process much easier. I have already implemented a couple of ideas from there, and it really has become calmer)) I turned off all notifications except for personal messages, turned off the display of my status, and try to share as much information about my work as possible in the general chat with people whom it concerns.
