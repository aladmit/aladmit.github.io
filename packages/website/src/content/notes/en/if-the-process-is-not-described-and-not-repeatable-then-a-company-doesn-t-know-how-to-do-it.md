title: If the process is not described and not repeatable, then a company doesn't know how to do it
---

Looking at the previous post, I realized that it can be extended to any activity in the company.

If the company has clearly described the process of some activity, then it understands how to do it, how to evaluate the result, and how to influence it. If it not only understands but also does it systematically, then it knows how to do it, and possibly even well ðŸ˜„

In the case where some activity in the company is not described and not done regularly, then either the company doesn't know how to do it at all or does it very poorly.

For example, if you don't have instructions on how and when to write documentation, then the company doesn't know how to write documentation. People just won't understand how to do it correctly and how to evaluate the result. As a result, either no one uses the documentation at all, or it significantly lags behind reality, or it is organized in such a way that it is difficult to use. In general, everything is sad ðŸ™‚

And it seems like it's the same with everything. No process description and no regular repetitions - we either don't know how to do it or do it poorly.
