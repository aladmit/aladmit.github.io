title: Burnout in State of DevOps 2019
---

There is a very interesting section in the State of DevOps 2019 report - Productivity.

In this section, the study claims that taking breaks from work helps reduce burnout and provides a list of recommendations on how to do it:

1. Don't think about work outside of work hours
2. Relax after work
3. Learn and practice skills outside of work that bring joy
4. Compensate for lack of control over work-related activities by engaging in activities outside of work that you can control
5. Foster a culture of leaving work in your company. Leave work early, don't stay late, encourage colleagues to do the same.

The study also claims that people from low-performing companies feel burned out twice as often as people from high-performing companies.

It makes sense. High performers have already established the development process, and operations are streamlined, so there's hardly any reason for stress or burnout. So here's another good reason to strive for high or even elite performance :)
