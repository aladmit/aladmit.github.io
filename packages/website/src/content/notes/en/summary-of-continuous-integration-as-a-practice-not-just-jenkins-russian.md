title: Summary of "Continuous Integration as a practice, not just Jenkins" (Russian)
---

[@patsevanton](https://t.me/@patsevanton) wrote a summary (almost verbatim!) of my talk on "Continuous Integration as a practice, not just Jenkins". So if you prefer reading to watching, welcome ðŸ™‚

The beauty of the summary is that we added text for the first 10 slides that didn't make it to the recording for technical reasons ðŸ”¥

P.S. Overall, Anton's repository is quite interesting, I also recommend reading the summary of Alexander Kukushkin's talk from Zalando "Typical mistakes when building high-performance clusters and how to avoid them".
