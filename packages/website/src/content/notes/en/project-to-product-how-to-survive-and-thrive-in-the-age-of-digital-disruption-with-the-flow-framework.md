I highly recommend this book to all managers, leaders, and owners of IT companies.

It explains:
1. The difference between projects and products, and why it's important to focus on products.
2. Why the software development analogy of a factory production line is flawed.
3. How to connect all the artifacts in your company into a single Value Stream Network.
4. How to identify bottlenecks in your company using the Value Stream Network.
5. How the Value Stream Network helps prioritize tasks, make business decisions, and see how the entire company operates.
