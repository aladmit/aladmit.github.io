title: Upskilling Enterprise DevOps Skills Report 2019
---

I read the results of the Upskilling: Enterprise DevOps Skills Report 2019 this weekend. The researchers investigated the skills needed for transforming a company. It was great to see that mostly leaders, managers, and even a few C-level executives (6%) participated in the survey.

The results were sad. Most companies want to hire a DevOps Engineer. Unfortunately, not everyone in the IT industry understands that this won't solve their problems 🙁 
The majority of the report indicates that companies see DevOps as automation and therefore consider automation skills the most important.

The second and third most important skills are "Process Skills and Knowledge" and "Soft Skills". This gives me hope that one day our industry will emerge from this quagmire 🙂
