Now I'm working on an intensive course on **Trunk Based Development**, and I need help with creating the program. I have talked about Trunk many times, but it has always been in response to a specific request. This time we are talking about a large public intensive course. Please read the program and let me know what you think [privately](http://t.me/aladmit), by email at aleksandrov@hey.com, or in the comments on [Telegram channel](http://t.me/aladmit_world).

What is missing? What seems unnecessary? What questions do you have about Trunk that you would like to get an answer to?

The purpose of the intensive is to give the participants a complete picture of the work on TBD and answer the questions:
How is this fundamentally different from other models?
- how the team will benefit from TBD
- what practices help to work on TBD
- what will hinder the transition to TBD

For whom I usually talk about TBD: developers, testers, team leads, tech leads, development managers, CTOs. I think that a similar audience will come to the intensive.
