title: State of DevOps in Russia
---

In the community, there has long been a discussion about the problem that all statistics are about the Western part of the industry, mostly about America, and we ourselves do not know how things are going here. And now it has happened! Express42 has launched the first study on the state of DevOps in Russia. Just like DORA, only about us and more modest))

What I liked about the survey:
- the collection of 4 key DevOps metrics, which is very pleasing. Now we will be able to compare Russia with the rest of the world and also our companies with competitors within the country ðŸ”¥

- questions about platforms. This topic is of interest in the country and the industry, and it was discussed at TechLeadConf, but it is still unknown how much of it has actually appeared in companies. So, let's take a look))

- I would like to highlight separately the small blocks about the dissemination of practices and team interaction. I hope there will be more of this next year.

They are also collecting information about the impact of the pandemic on companies, who is using which tools, the implementation of IaC and clouds, which is also useful, but personally, I am not very interested in it.

I have already taken the survey myself and I urge you to do the same. The more data Express42 collects, the more accurate picture of our industry segment we will get ðŸ’ª
