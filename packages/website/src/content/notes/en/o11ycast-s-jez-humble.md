Since I've started recommending podcast episodes, I'll recommend another one)

In o11ycast, there is a wonderful episode with Jez Humble! He is one of the founders of DORA, co-author of the books DevOps Handbook, Accelerate, Lean Enterprise and, of course, Continuous Delivery.

In the episode, they discussed:
- the importance of teamwork skills
- the complexity of modern systems, which can no longer be created alone
- transformational leadership
- observability
