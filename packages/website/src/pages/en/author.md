# Andrey Aleksandrov 

I have gained a very diverse work experience in IT: I have written backends, frontends, optimized systems, built platforms, managed projects, teams, and small departments. In each of these roles, I was interested in understanding the main challenges, what engineering practices and processes are needed, and how it all fits into the overall picture of software production. Later on, I found out that such interest and diverse experience can be well combined with a career as a consultant and expert. I gained my first consulting experience at Express42 in 2018-2019, and now I am doing it as part of my team at [enabling.team](https://enabling.team).
